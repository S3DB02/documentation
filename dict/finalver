## <a name="Background"></a>2. Background

Brainwaves are the patterns of electrical activity that occur in the brain. They are produced by the synchronized electrical pulses from masses of neurons communicating with each other. Brainwaves are detected using an electroencephalogram (EEG), a device that measures and records these electrical activities by detecting them with electrodes placed on the scalp.

They are distinguished by their different frequency ranges. The frequency is measured in cycles, the number of times neurons are firing per second. Brainwaves also vary in amplitude with lower amplitudes as they speed up. The higher frequency the wave the more alert and "awake" you are. There are several types of brainwaves, which are typically divided into five bands: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma.

- **Delta waves (0.5 - 4 Hz):** These are the slowest brain waves and are typically associated with deep, dreamless sleep and unconscious processes. In adults, they're usually only produced during the deepest stages of sleep. An increase in delta waves outside of sleep can be a sign of brain injury or dysfunction.

- **Theta waves (4 - 8 Hz):** These brainwaves occur during states of light sleep and deep relaxation, often associated with daydreaming or the first stage of sleep. In a waking state, they are connected with creativity, intuition, emotions, and reflection. Increased theta waves can also be associated with activities that require deep concentration.

- **Alpha waves (8 - 13 Hz):** Alpha waves are typically associated with relaxed, calm, and lucid mental states but not focused on the outside world. They're often seen when the eyes are closed and during practices like mindfulness or meditation. They can serve as a bridge between the conscious and the subconscious mind.

- **Beta waves (13 - 30 Hz):** These brainwaves are associated with a state of wakefulness, attention, and normal consciousness. They're involved in logical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. High levels of beta waves can indicate excitement, stress, or anxiety.

- **Gamma waves (30 - 100 Hz):** Gamma waves are the fastest brain waves and are associated with higher mental activity, including perception, problem-solving, and cognition. They're also linked to the processing of information from different brain areas. Some studies suggest that increased gamma wave activity may be associated with meditative states and heightened focus.

The integration of neuroscience and computer science has opened new avenues for brain-computer interfaces (BCI), systems that allow direct brain control of a computer. There are several prominent branches of AI involved in this research, including Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Robotics.

- **Machine Learning (ML)**, the most prevalent branch of AI, involves creating algorithms that learn from and make decisions based on data. For instance, deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, has been instrumental in interpreting EEG data for diagnosing neurological disorders.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It has wide applications in creating user-friendly interfaces for BCIs, enhancing the interaction between the user and the device.

- **Computer Vision** deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It has potential in analyzing visual data from EEGs, potentially improving the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.

- **Robotics**, another branch of AI, involves creating robots that interact with their surroundings. It has potential applications in developing advanced prosthetics controlled directly by the brain.

AI, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning, have been used in the analysis and interpretation of EEG data. This could be for various purposes such as diagnosing neurological disorders, BCIs, mental state monitoring, and even neurofeedback training.

The study is innovative in its use of EOG and EEG signals and provides promising preliminary results, especially with the combined EOG-EEG-based paradigm.

**Gaps and Future Research:** The research is still ongoing and there are areas for improvement and further exploration. Future work will focus on refining the algorithms, increasing the recognition accuracy rates, evolving the current system into an asynchronous one, and integrating new commands. Further tests are also planned to determine the best paradigm for the project.

**Conclusion:** The research presents an innovative approach to assist people with severe neuromuscular disorders by controlling a robotic arm using bioelectrical signals. While the research is still ongoing, preliminary results are promising, especially for the combined EOG-EEG-based paradigm. Future work will focus on refining the system and further tests to determine the optimal paradigm.
