# <a name="intro"></a>Intro

This portfolio will guide you through several snippets of my work during the [period of time]. This repository will act as a summary of my work in this period, along with explanations of how I proved a certain set of learning outcomes.

Down below, I will provide you with the learning outcomes as they are at the time of writing ([date]), with the explanation of each outcome. This will be followed with a table containing all of my work proving the outcomes.
